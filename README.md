Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
- For this assignment the client was Creative Technology Solutions and they wanted us to start the process of creating a web based game application that was called Draw it or loose it and it that was a game where there was teams and there was rounds abnd there would be a drawer and the team would guess the image that was shown on the screen from randomly selected images in a timed manner and then they would keep track of their points and try to be the team with the most points at the end.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
-I think that something that I did well in this prodject was by leaving a lot of information about the different systems and stuff in order to better understand how the different systems work so that I could pick which one I thought would work the best for this prodject

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
- I think that it was helpful because for the design document that meant that I had to learn about the different systems so then I could also better understand what I was delaing with the system and could then understand what all the code that we had to do meant more 


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- I would redo the table if I had to do something over becasue even though i did learn a lot about the different systems from doing that table but i am sure that there is a lot of other information that could go into that table that I did not touch on.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- I think that it is important to consider the user because they are the ones that are going to be using it and if they are not happy with how the system operates then they probably will not want to use the application as much if they experiance problems with it or other difficulties 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
- I just took the the prodjects one by one and everytime learning a bit more about the operating systems and how they work and operate and from the learning resources that we were given and also the web I was able to learn a lot about computers and how they operate so that I could create this software design document
